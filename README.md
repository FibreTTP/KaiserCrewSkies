# Kaisers-Custom-Crew-Skies
For the crewwww

Custom skies and item textures available for Forge and **Fabric**!! A repository for any Crew fans that want a Crew-themed Resource Pack! The latest version has (in my opinion) the best and most updated textures/sounds.

## Installation

### Resource Pack
Download the [latest pack]() (NOT Source code) from the Releases Page.
- Open Minecraft.
- Go to Options > Resource Packs.
- Click "Open resource pack folder".
- Move the pack zip into the folder that just opened.
- Select the pack in Minecraft.

You can install this resource pack without any mods, but you won't see the custom sky, moon phases, and variable item textures. Use either one of the two mod loaders below to see them.

### Forge
Install [Forge Mod Loader](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) and [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/home), then follow the [Resource Pack installation](#resource-pack).

If you're playing a Forge modpack like The Purge S2 :eyes:, then you already have the Forge Mod Loader and all you need to install is OptiFine.


### Fabric

If you are playing on a Fabric modpack, you most likely have many of these mods already installed.

Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/), [FabricSkyBoxes](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabricskyboxes), [FabricSkyBoxes Interop](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabricskyboxes-interop), [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn), and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api); then follow the [Resource Pack installation](#resource-pack).

**ENSURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE CORRECT MOD VERSIONS FOR YOUR MINECRAFT VERSION**.

To get dynamic lights, shaders, particle/detail settings, etc. install these highly recommended[^lambdaurora] mods to achieve feature parity with OptiFine. Trust me, it's worth it:
- [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris). A Shader Mod.  
	[BSL Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/bsl-shaders) is phenomenal when combined with this pack. Although, it's really bright so Elon just straight up becomes Speedy. Use these settings:
	- Atmospherics > Clouds and Sky Desaturation turned off
	- Lighting > Sun Path Rotation set to 0.0
	- Color > Lighting > Minimum Light > Intensity set to 0.90
- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium). Required for Iris to work. It will also boost your FPS.
- [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights). Holding light sources will... light up your surroundings. If you want to turn it off, you need to install [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to access the mod's configuration screen.

Additionally, install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) if you play with a Fabric modpack to make other mods compatible with the Sodium renderer.
