# Kaisers-Custom-Crew-Skies
For the crewwww

A repository for any Crew fans that want a Crew-themed Resource Pack! The latest version has the (in my opinion) best and most updated textures/ sounds.

INSTALL DIRECTIONS:
-Open Minecraft
-Go to Options
-Go to Resource Packs
-Click "Open resource pack folder"
-Copy/Paste the entire pack ZIP folder into this folder
-(Most people have to then unzip the resource pack's inner folder into Minecraft's resource pack folder).
-Select the pack in Minecraft

DM Me on discord with any questions!
